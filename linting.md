# Linting

We use https://github.com/feross/standard as our linter.  It is implemented by default within [boiler-room-builder](https://github.com/everydayhero/boiler-room-builder) via the command  `brb lint` .  

An example of using boiler-room-builder to implement linting is available within [warp-gate](https://github.com/everydayhero/warp-gate/blob/master/ui/package.json#L32-L33).
